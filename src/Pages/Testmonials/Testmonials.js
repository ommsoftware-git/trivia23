                    These guys are the best movers that I have ever used! With
                    all of the positive reviews, how could I go wrong? I called
                    them and had constant communication with Derek via phone and
                    email and felt reassured that everything was going to be
                    taken care of.

                    1st Choice Movers came highly recommended to me from a
                    friend who had booked several moves with this company. I
                    contacted Derek and he emailed me directly with a quote
                    within 20 minutes.

                    I would 100% recommend 1st Choice Movers again. I had the
                    pleasure of working with Stivan an Ogen who were extremely
                    fast, organized and able to answer all of my questions. I
                    canâ€™t even believe I was considering moving myself, these
                    guys made it so easy.
